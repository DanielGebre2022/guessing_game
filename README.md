Create a program that plays a guessing game. The program will secretly select a number between 1 and 100 (or a 1 and 1000 if you want it to be a little more challenging.) It will prompt the use for a guess. The user starts with 10 points and gets 10 guesses. After each guess the program will tell the user whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. If correct the game end. Each wrong guess subtracts a point. After the last guess, or a correct guess,  the program prints out the secret number and the score. This program will test your use of Loops and branches as well as basic prompts, inputs and assignments. You can work on the program until it works--there is no time limit despite the due date.

Scoring:

Selecting a random number: 10 points

Variables and assignments: 10 points

Naming conventions: 10 following standard naming conventions for variables.

Inputs: 10 (this includes a prompt explaining the game, prompting for a guess,)

Outputs: 10 (outputting results of  quesses (high,low, correct) and outputting the score at the end)

Loops: 25 points (The game itself will need to couched in a loop, for extra credit (5 points) you can make it so when the game is over it asks if they want to play another game.)

Branches: 25 (testing the guesses, determining if the guess matches the secret number)

scoring: 10 (subtracting one for each wrong answer. Maintaining the score outside the loop)

Total 100 points

You can turn the code in by uploading as test, linking to a github site, or pasting it in a google doc and sharing. I would rather you didn't upload it as a .java file.

## Thoughts
Created a guessing game per assignment instructions. Also added a score keeping method in order to record previous Scores. I gave this score keeping method the ability to keep track of recent scores, high scores and average scores. One other addition I added was I made String Arrays to hold different comments to make the game feel more spontaneous and slightly less predictable comments from the program. Very primitive I know and I'm sure there is a better way to do it but..... I will continue to work on it beyond the assignment due date. The main thing I will take from this assignment is the importance and efficiency of variables and methods in as much as when you need to adjust something you can do it in one place rather than all over the place. And my code was only a couple hundred lines. I can only imagine thousands or tens of thousands or god forbid millions..... Up until now my code has been 10, 20 simple lines but I CLEARLY see now how having to individually correct different pieces of data can be a nightmare.
